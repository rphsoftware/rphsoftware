# Hello, I am Rph

Congratulations, you found my Github public profile. As a reward, let me tell you something about myself.

## General info

* I'm a 19 year old hobbyist software developer from Poland

No, this doesn't mean I will steal your car. It also doesn't guarantee high quality code. To github I mostly publish small tools that I consider fully done and ready for usage, however you also may find testing repositories.

* I am versatile in the programming languages that I use

On here you will find projects in javascript, rust, java, golang and general web technologies

* Pronouns: they/them

## Where I can be found
